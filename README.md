Developing strategies for parallel RETIS.

For many years, I've written programs to perform computer simulations of
chemistry. Now it appears that I've written a program to perform a computer
simulation of a computer simulation of chemistry. "Simception."

The details of the ideas are in the `ParallelRETISGame.ipynb` notebook.
